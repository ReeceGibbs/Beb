                Happy Anniversary, my love!<br/>
                These past twelve months with you have been nothing short of amazing.
                My mind still boggles at the sheer number of memories we have managed to rack up 
                in such a short space of time. From every hug, to every cuddle, to every doughnut and to every 
                unbelievable conversation we have ever had. You are my soulmate and I have loved every single 
                second I have spent with you. You are the most beautiful, intelligent and caring human being 
                I have come across in all my twenty two years of life and I am so very lucky to be able 
                to call you mine. We have an unbelievable number of adventures coming up and that brings me unfathomable 
                levels of excitement. There is no one else I would rather call my own and I cannot wait to carry on our adventure 
                through this flipping phenomenal life we have ahead of us.<br/>
                I love you, Georgia.<br/>
                Here's to the best year of my life thus far.
